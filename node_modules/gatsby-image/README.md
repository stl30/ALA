# gatsby-image

Speedy, optimized images without the work.

`gatsby-image` is a React component specially designed to work seamlessly with
Gatsby's GraphQL queries. It combines
[Gatsby's native image processing](https://image-processing.gatsbyjs.org/)
capabilities with advanced image loading techniques to easily and completely
optimize image loading for your sites. `gatsby-image` uses
[gatsby-plugin-sharp](/packages/gatsby-plugin-sharp/)
to power its image transformations.

_Warning: gatsby-image is **not** a drop-in replacement for `<img />`. It's
optimized for fixed width/height images and images that stretch the full-width
of a container. Some ways you can use `<img />` won't work with gatsby-image._

**[Demo](https://using-gatsby-image.gatsbyjs.org)**

## Problem

Large, unoptimized images dramatically slow down your site.

But creating optimized images for websites has long been a thorny problem.
Ideally you would:

- Resize large images to the size needed by your design
- Generate multiple smaller images so smartphones and tablets don't download
  desktop-sized images
- Strip all unnecessary metadata and optimize JPEG and PNG compression
- Efficiently lazy load images to speed initial page load and save bandwidth
- Use the "blur-up" technique or a
  "[traced placeholder](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/2435)" SVG to
  show a preview of the image while it loads
- Hold the image position so your page doesn't jump while images load

Doing this consistently across a site feels like sisyphean labor. You manually
optimize your images and then… several images are swapped in at the last minute
or a design-tweak shaves 100px of width off your images.

Most solutions involve a lot of manual labor and bookkeeping to ensure every
image is optimized.

This isn't ideal. Optimized images should be easy and the default.

## Solution

With Gatsby, we can make images way _way_ better.

`gatsby-image` is designed to work seamlessly with Gatsby's native image
processing capabilities powered by GraphQL and Sharp. To produce perfect images,
you need only:

1. Import `gatsby-image` and use it in place of the built-in `img`
2. Write a GraphQL query using one of the included GraphQL "fragments"
    which specify the fields needed by `gatsby-image`.

The GraphQL query creates multiple thumbnails with optimized JPEG and PNG
compression. The `gatsby-image` component automatically sets up the "blur-up"
effect as well as lazy loading of images further down the screen.

## Install

`npm install --save gatsby-image`

Depending on the gatsby starter you used, you may need to include [gatsby-transformer-sharp](/packages/gatsby-transformer-sharp/) and [gatsby-plugin-sharp](/packages/gatsby-plugin-sharp/) as well, and make sure they are installed and included in your gatsby-config.

```bash
npm install --save gatsby-transformer-sharp
npm install --save gatsby-plugin-sharp
```

Then in your `gatsby-config.js`:

```js
plugins: [
  `gatsby-transformer-sharp`,
  `gatsby-plugin-sharp`
];
```

Also, make sure you have set up a source plugin, so your images are available in `graphql` queries. For example, if your images live in a project folder on the local filesystem, you would set up `gatsby-source-filesystem` in `gatsby-config.js` like so:

```js
const path = require(`path`)

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        name: `images`,
        path: path.join(__dirname, `src`, `images`),
      },
    },
    `gatsby-plugin-sharp`,
    `gatsby-transformer-sharp`,
  ],
}
```

## How to use

This is what a component using `gatsby-image` looks like:

```jsx
import React from "react"
import Img from "gatsby-image"

export default ({ data }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello gatsby-image</h1>
    <Img fixed={data.file.childImageSharp.fixed} />
  </div>
)

export const query = graphql`
  query {
    file(relativePath: { eq: "blog/avatars/kyle-mathews.jpeg" }) {
      childImageSharp {
        # Specify the image processing specifications right in the query.
        # Makes it trivial to update as your page's design changes.
        fixed(width: 125, height: 125) {
          ...GatsbyImageSharpFixed
        }
      }
    }
  }
`
```

For other explanations of how to get started with gatsby-image, see this blog post by community member Kyle Gill [Image Optimization Made Easy with Gatsby.js](https://medium.com/@kyle.robert.gill/ridiculously-easy-image-optimization-with-gatsby-js-59d48e15db6e) or this one by Hunter Chang (which also includes some details about changes to gatsby-image for Gatsby v2): [An Intro To Gatsby Image V2](https://codebushi.com/using-gatsby-image/)

## Two types of responsive images

There are two types of responsive images supported by gatsby-image.

1. Images that have a _fixed_ width and height
2. Images that stretch across a _fluid_ container

In the first scenario, you want to vary the image's size for different screen
resolutions -- in other words, create retina images.

For the second scenario, you want to create multiple sizes of thumbnails for
devices with widths stretching from smartphone to wide desktop monitors.

To decide between the two, ask yourself: "do I know the exact size this image
will be?" If yes, it's the first type. If no and its width and/or height need to
vary depending on the size of the screen, then it's the second type.

In Gatsby's GraphQL implementation, you query for the first type by querying a
child object of an image called `fixed` — which you can see in the sample
component above. For the second type, you do a similar query but for a child
object called `fluid`.

## Fragments

GraphQL includes a concept called "query fragments". Which, as the name
suggests, are a part of a query that can be used in multiple queries. To ease
building with `gatsby-image`, Gatsby image processing plugins which support
`gatsby-image` ship with fragments which you can easily include in your queries.

Note,
[due to a limitation of GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/issues/612),
you can not currently use these fragments in the GraphiQL IDE.

Plugins supporting `gatsby-image` currently include
[gatsby-transformer-sharp](/packages/gatsby-transformer-sharp/),
[gatsby-source-contentful](/packages/gatsby-source-contentful/) and [gatsby-source-datocms](https://github.com/datocms/gatsby-source-datocms).

Their fragments are:

### gatsby-transformer-sharp

- `GatsbyImageSharpFixed`
- `GatsbyImageSharpFixed_noBase64`
- `GatsbyImageSharpFixed_tracedSVG`
- `GatsbyImageSharpFixed_withWebp`
- `GatsbyImageSharpFixed_withWebp_noBase64`
- `GatsbyImageSharpFixed_withWebp_tracedSVG`
- `GatsbyImageSharpFluid`
- `GatsbyImageSharpFluid_noBase64`
- `GatsbyImageSharpFluid_tracedSVG`
- `GatsbyImageSharpFluid_withWebp`
- `GatsbyImageSharpFluid_withWebp_noBase64`
- `GatsbyImageSharpFluid_withWebp_tracedSVG`

### gatsby-source-contentful

- `GatsbyContentfulFixed`
- `GatsbyContentfulFixed_noBase64`
- `GatsbyContentfulFixed_tracedSVG`
- `GatsbyContentfulFixed_withWebp`
- `GatsbyContentfulFixed_withWebp_noBase64`
- `GatsbyContentfulFluid`
- `GatsbyContentfulFluid_noBase64`
- `GatsbyContentfulFluid_tracedSVG`
- `GatsbyContentfulFluid_withWebp`
- `GatsbyContentfulFluid_withWebp_noBase64`

### gatsby-source-datocms

- `GatsbyDatoCmsFixed`
- `GatsbyDatoCmsFixed_noBase64`
- `GatsbyDatoCmsFluid`
- `GatsbyDatoCmsFluid_noBase64`

If you don't want to use the blur-up effect, choose the fragment with `noBase64`
at the end. If you want to use the traced placeholder SVGs, choose the fragment
with `tracedSVG` at the end.

If you want to automatically use WebP images when the browser supports the file
format, use the `withWebp` fragments. If the browser doesn't support WebP,
`gatsby-image` will fall back to the default image format.

_Please see the
[gatsby-plugin-sharp](/packages/gatsby-plugin-sharp/#tracedsvg)
documentation for more information on `tracedSVG` and its configuration
options._

## "Fixed" queries

### Component

Pass in the data returned from the `fixed` object in your query via the
`fixed` prop. e.g. `<Img fixed={fixed} />`

### Query

```graphql
{
  imageSharp {
    # Other options include height (set both width and height to crop),
    # grayscale, duotone, rotate, etc.
    fixed(width: 400) {
      # Choose either the fragment including a small base64ed image, a traced placeholder SVG, or one without.
      ...GatsbyImageSharpFixed
    }
  }
}
```

## "Fluid" queries

### Component

Pass in the data returned from the `fluid` object in your query via the `fluid`
prop. e.g. `<Img fluid={fluid} />`

### Query

```graphql
{
  imageSharp {
    # i.e. the max width of your container is 700 pixels.
    #
    # Other options include maxHeight (set both maxWidth and maxHeight to crop),
    # grayscale, duotone, rotate, etc.
    fluid(maxWidth: 700) {
      # Choose either the fragment including a small base64ed image, a traced placeholder SVG, or one without.
      ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid_noBase64
    }
  }
}
```

## Image processing arguments

[gatsby-plugin-sharp](/packages/gatsby-plugin-sharp) supports many additional arguments for transforming your images like
`quality`, `sizeByPixelDensity`, `pngCompressionLevel`, `cropFocus`, `greyscale` and many more. See its documentation for more.

## Some other stuff to be aware of

- If you want to set `display: none;` on a component using a `fixed` prop,
  you need to also pass in to the style prop `{ display: 'inherit' }`.
- By default, images don't load until JavaScript is loaded. Gatsby's automatic code
  splitting generally makes this fine but if images seem slow coming in on a
  page, check how much JavaScript is being loaded there.
- Images marked as `critical` will start loading immediately as the DOM is
  parsed, but unless `fadeIn` is set to `false`, the transition from placeholder
  to final image will not occur until after the component is mounted.
- Gatsby-Image now is backed by newer `<picture>` tag. This newer standard allows for
  media types to be chosen by the browser without using JavaScript. It also is
  backward compatible to older browsers (IE 11, etc)
- Gifs can't be resized the same way as pngs and jpegs, unfortunately—if you try
  to use a gif with `gatsby-image`, it won't work. For now, the best workaround is
  to [import the gif directly](/docs/adding-images-fonts-files).
